        <p>Our "whale waste" project is a project that aims to fight against pollution in the sea because for our project we only use waste found and recovered in the sea. Then we use them, transform them to make works of art.<br> 
        </p>

        <p>In addition, our project is a project that wants to reach as many people as possible, and that is why we intend to create lots of works around the world so that it can impact everyone because it is a subject that is vital for the future. And it is progressing because we already have our whale "whale waste" in France then a seahorse in Germany in Berlin. And for our next project we intend to carry it out in Brazil in the capital Brasilia.<br>

        <strong><em>Why</em></strong>
    </div>
    <hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity">
    <div class="text_expliquation"> 
        <p>- Plastic pollution: Some 8 to 12 million tonnes of plastic are dumped into the oceans every year, the equivalent of one plastic dump truck per minute. In all, it is estimated that there are between 75 and 199 million tonnes of plastic currently in the oceans. By 2050, if no action is taken, there could be more plastic than fish in the oceans.<br> 
        </p>

        <p>Micro plastics: Currently, there are an estimated 51,000 billion microplastics floating on the surface of the oceans, representing around 269,000 tonnes of fragmented plastic. These microplastics come from the degradation of plastic waste and various sources such as synthetic clothing and tires
        dead zones1: There are over 400 dead zones in the oceans, covering an area of around 245,000 km² (about the size of the UK). These areas lack oxygen due to nutrient pollutants from agricultural fertilizers, which cause algal blooms and suffocate marine life.<br>
        </p>

        <p>- Fuel spill: Some 706 million gallons of fuel enter the oceans every year, from industrial accidents, natural leaks and shipping discharges. These spills cause significant damage to coastal and marine ecosystems, particularly birds, fish and marine mammals.<br>
        </p>

        <p>- Acidification: Since the beginning of the industrial era, the oceans have become 26% more acidic, due to increased absorption of carbon dioxide (CO₂). This acidification particularly affects corals and mollusks, threatening entire marine ecosystems that depend on these habitats.
        “dead zone”, is a hypoxic zone where the water contains little dissolved oxygen. These oxygen-deficient zones can occur in all types of aquatic environment: oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, etc.<br>
        </p>
        
        <p>There are naturally low-oxygen zones. For example, beyond a depth of 200 meters, the waters of the Black Sea contain no dissolved oxygen, while the concentration of hydrogen sulfide is high. Dead zones, on the other hand, are not natural: the lack of dissolved oxygen is abnormal. The duration of this phenomenon varies: a few days, a few months, or the whole year.

    <div class="text_expliquation"> 
        <p>We also had to do more testing, several models for our project because we had several problems like during the modeling phase that we had to start over a good number of times because our machine was not powerful enough to render and crash the machine. That's why we had to limit ourselves to the whale objects so that it wouldn't crash.<br> 
        </p>

        <p>Just like the site where we encountered some problems like the menu button which was a real pain to do. And the phone version which was not easy to develop. There was the publication of the website where it was complicated to find a good host.<br>
